    <p>    Hello everyone!  My name is Darren Sheffer and I am from Northern Utah.  I was born and raised there and really enjoy
    spending some of the warmer fall days in the mountains, when the trees are all kinds of different colors.  Some other things
    I enjoy are playing video games, drawing, reading, and writing.  An interesting fact about me is I have traveled to 49 of the
    50 United States. (Missing Hawaii)</p>
